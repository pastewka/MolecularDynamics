# Strong scaling

A typical scaling metric in HPC is *strong scaling*, or the reduction of
time-to-solution (TTS) when the number of processing units is increased, for a
fixed problem size. It is usually plotted as the *speedup* $$T\_1 / T\_p$$, where
$$ T\_1 $$ is the TTS for a single process, and $$ T\_p $$ for $$p$$ processes.
